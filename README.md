# 03-Text-Adventure
This text adventure was developed for the third/fourth week of class

Only the beginning of the game is programmed because I intend to keep working on it and redo parts of it when I learn more python code.  In my game, the player wakes up in a room and can't remember what he's doing there, and finds a note left by a mysterious group saying to find them.  He goes outside to find that the Earth has been scorched, and then sets out to find whoever left the note.

To make the game, I downloaded an engine and then worked off of the starting point given to us.  I programmed different rooms and locations, and connected these places with different directions that could be inputted by the player.

Thanks for reading, hope you enjoy!
